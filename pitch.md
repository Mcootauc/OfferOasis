# Pitch

## State the final inspiration statement that you crafted for your chosen audience

-   Teenagers are people who need a way to sell and buy new products because they value shopping.

## State the possible solutions from preliminary ideation that you considered

-   The two possible solutions that I came up with are a marketplace or an e-commerce store web app.

## State the final app idea that your team has decided to do

-   I am creating a marketplace web app where teenagers can sell or buy products. Teenagers need shopping and will always need a new place to buy products. To enhance the user experience, the app will leverage the Google Maps API, providing an interactive feature that showcases the location of each listed item on a dynamic Google Maps widget. The interface will present essential details such as the item's image and price.
